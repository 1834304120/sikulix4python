# sikulix4python
Use SikuliX from real [Python via py4j](https://www.py4j.org) (but no need to know, how it works ;-)

**under development -- no guarentee for anything :-)**

... but you might post issues (questions, bugs, ideas, requests, ...)

**What you need**
 - the latest 1.1.4 sikulixapi.jar (https://raiman.github.io/SikuliX1/downloads.html)
 - a Python installation 2.7 up to 3.7 (3.7 recommended)
 - a mature Python IDE (I use IntelliJ's PyCharm) or just a Python REPL.
 
**How to test**

Currently it is recommended, to fork this project and work in the project context.

But this should also be possible:
 - copy the folder ``sikulix4python`` from inside the project to a place, where your Python will find it, when imported
 
In both cases:
 - put ``from sikulix4phyton import *`` at the beginning of your test script
 - use stuff from ``sxundotted`` just as is
 - use stuff from ``sxclasses`` to access features of the SikuliX API classes like Region, Screen, Location ...
 
Currently you have to look into the Python files, to find out, what is possible.

**How is the SikuliX Java API accessed from Python**

Before running Python scripts this way, you have to start a SikuliX server instance manually:

``java -jar path-to/sikulixapi.jar pythonserver``

When you see this in the terminal window, it is running:

```
MÃ¤rz 15, 2019 10:26:20 VORM. py4Java.GatewayServer fireServerStarted
INFO: Gateway Server Started
```

**What is the plan**
 - have the complete official SikuliX API with docs available at time of script development (autocomplete, docs, help, ...)
 - be able to additionally access every public method from the SikuliX Java API (you must know the method signature)
 - have a handy solution for handling image path's of imported scripts/modules
 - run existing SikuliX scripts without changes (... but there will surely be exceptions)
 
**Things you should be aware off**
- you might get any problem at any time, since the current state is ``proof of concept``
- anything might be changed at any time without notice
- errors and warnings you get in the terminal window can be ignored, as long as it works as intended on the Python side
- output coming from the SikuliX Java API is currently only going to the terminal window
- my current development work is on macOS 10.14, Java 11, Python 3.7 with PyCharm (no tests on Windows nor Linux yet)

**An example**

```
from sikulix4python import *
hover()
scr = Screen()
scr.getCenter() #.grow(100).highlight(2)
```
